# 🫢 Knapsack Problem Solver

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Knapsack Problem** using two approaches:
- **Brute Force** 
- **Dynamic Programming**

The program performs multiple experiments to test and compare the performance of both methods. It generates random weights and values for items, calculates the maximum value achievable within a given capacity, and outputs the results for each experiment.

## 🌌 About the Project

The **Knapsack Problem Solver** explores the computational efficiency of solving the classic Knapsack Problem using:
1. **Brute Force**: Evaluates all possible combinations.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Uses a more efficient tabular approach.

### What is the Knapsack Problem?
The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to maximize the total value of items placed into a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. Each item has a specific weight and value, and the challenge is to determine the most valuable combination of items that can fit within the given constraints. This problem has applications in resource allocation, finance, logistics, and more.

### Sample Outputs
- Items with randomly assigned weights and values.
- Maximum value achievable within the knapsack's capacity.
- List of selected items contributing to the solution.

## ⚙️ Features

- Randomized experiments for variability in problem scenarios.
- Performance comparison of two distinct algorithms.
- Detailed output of selected items, their weights, and values.
